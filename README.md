## Macro Code

    // SaveOpenFiles_asTIFF
    // This ImageJ macro saves all open images as TIFF files
    // and saves to a selected directory
    
    dir = getDirectory("Choose a Directory");  // Prompt the user to select a folder and store the path in the     variable 'dir'

    for (i=0; i<nImages; i++) {  // Loop through all open images (nImages is the number of currently open images)

        selectImage(i + 1);  // Select the (i+1)th image (ImageJ uses 1-based indexing)

        title = getTitle;  // Get the title (filename) of the currently selected image

        print(title);  // Print the image title to the log window for tracking

        // ids[i] = getImageID;  // (Commented out) This would store each imageâ€™s unique ID if needed

        saveAs("tiff", dir + title);  // Save the current image as a TIFF file in the chosen directory with its     title as the filename
    } 

    run("Close All");  // Close all open images after saving is complete
